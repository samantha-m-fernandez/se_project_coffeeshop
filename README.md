# Triple Peaks Coffee Shop

The Triple Peaks Coffee shop is my second school project utilizing advanced HTML and CSS that we have learned in our second sprint. This website meets modern design standards and includes sections such as the menu, recipes, reservation form and some information about the shop itself.

## Project features

- Semantic HTML5
- Flexbox
- Positioning
- Flat BEM file structure
- A custom form
- CSS animation and transform

## Plan on improving the project

While the project currently meets the requirements set out in the brief, there are several areas where I see potential for future enhancements:
1. **Accessibility Enhancements**: could be improved by ensuring all images have descriptive `alt` attributes correctly implemented for better screen reader support.
2. **Interactive Features**: when we learn JavaScript I would like more interactive elements, such as a reservation form that provides instant feedback on available slots.
